# What the megabee, its wool, eggs, salve and brood label are called in the language the pass was launched
# in. A language is chosen at launch and never inside a scenario, so this feature asserts nothing about a
# language: it asserts against whichever one is active, and the coverage is two passes, `-Language English`
# and `-Language French`.
#
# WHY THE GAME AND NOT A FILE CHECK. Tests/test_mod.py proves the French files cover every owned text field,
# and the shared DefInjected checker proves each path resolves to a real field. Neither shows what the game
# DISPLAYS. In developer mode, which every Pickle run is in, a key missing from the active language is not
# shown as English: the game shows the English text in an accented form, letter by letter, so a missing
# French entry reads here as a wrong string instead of a clean one.
Feature: the texts are those of the language of the pass

  Background:
    Given the save "test-colony" is loaded

  Scenario: the megabee, its products and its brood are named in the active language
    Then Megabees Renew: the texts of the megabee are those of the active language
    And no errors were logged
